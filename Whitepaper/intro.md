### Overview

With the emergence of blockchain gaming, millions of users around the world were able to interact and dive into the crypto world. This led us to the idea of gamifying the most valuable and most important skill to learn, trading. Cultivating the values of accountability and responsibility is essential for every user interacting with the financial markets.

Trading teaches people how to react with or against the market, which makes them systematic and helps protect their capital against unwanted losses from market movements.
